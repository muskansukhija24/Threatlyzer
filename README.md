<h4>An App for the Malware Detection and Extraction of File 
Content in Isolated Window</h4>
<p>This project presents the Threatlyzer app, an 
advanced security system designed  or the proactive detection 
and isolated content analysis of both known and unknown 
malware variants. The system utilizes a dual-path detection 
mechanism, combining the speed of traditional signature-based 
detection with the adaptability of Machine Learning (ML) 
models, specifically Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) classifiers. Feature extraction is performed on file 
metadata, including TLSH checksums and network activity 
indicators, to accurately classify threats. Upon detection, the 
malicious file is contained using a sandboxing technique and its 
content is extracted and analyzed in a secure, isolated window. 
A Large Language Model (LLM) and a Bigdata-Hadoop 
framework are then used to generate a detailed, human
readable summary and analysis report of the file's potential 
actions and effects. The system achieved a classification 
accuracy of 91% and a malware precision of 94% on the test 
dataset. This approach not only provides a valuable layer of 
proactive defense against evolving threats but also enables safe, 
deep inspection of otherwise inaccessible data within infected 
files. </p>
